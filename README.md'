AUTHENTICATION APP BUILT WITH NODE, EXPRESS AND MONGODB.

This app allows users to authenticate to the back-end server through some of the most secure, fast and reliable javascript frameworks and libraries.

It can be easily integrated with any RESTful API and utilizes advanced cryptography to store username and password through a super-secure token (SHA256).

You can test it out with a supporting software like POSTMAN.
